# 👁️ Face Detection using OpenCV & Haar Cascade  

A simple yet powerful **face detection project** built using **Python, OpenCV, and Haar Cascade Classifier**.  
This project demonstrates the basics of **computer vision** and how machines can detect human faces from images, videos, or live camera input.

## 📌 Project Overview  
The aim of this project is to explore the fundamentals of **image processing and object detection** using OpenCV’s pre-trained Haar Cascade Classifier.  
It can detect human faces in **real-time** from webcam input or static images.

## ✨ Features  
- 📷 Detects faces in **images, videos, and webcam feeds**  
- ⚡ Real-time face detection with OpenCV  
- 🎯 Uses **Haar Cascade Classifier** (pre-trained model)  
- 🖼️ Draws bounding boxes around detected faces  
- 🧑 Works on **multiple faces** simultaneously
